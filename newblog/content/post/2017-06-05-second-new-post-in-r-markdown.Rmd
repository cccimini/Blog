Over the first week I have learned a great deal about the many uses of R. I have very little prior experience using any type of code and am new to R so there has been a steep learnign curve for me personally.  As a math major one thing I found intersting was creatin functions in R. 
```{r}
factorial <- function(n) {
  accumulator <- 1
  for (i in 1:n) accumulator = accumulator * i
  accumulator
}
```
The factoial is a function that I used often in my math class this past semester, so I liked the challenge to bould the finction in R.
