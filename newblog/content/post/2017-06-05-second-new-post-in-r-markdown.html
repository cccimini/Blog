<p>Over the first week I have learned a great deal about the many uses of R. I have very little prior experience using any type of code and am new to R so there has been a steep learnign curve for me personally. As a math major one thing I found intersting was creatin functions in R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>factorial &lt;- function(n) {
  accumulator &lt;- 1
  for (i in 1:n) accumulator = accumulator * i
  accumulator
}</code></pre>
<p>The factoial is a function that I used often in my math class this past semester, so I liked the challenge to bould the finction in R.</p>
