The National flower of South Africa is the King Protea.  I learned this yesterday when I was zip lining. The flower is faily large with pink petals and green leaves.  I found it on the side of a mountian and my tour guide pointed it out.

This flower is unlike anything I have ever seen from home.  I am from Boston, Massachusetts  and the flora is different in the Northeast of the United States than here in South Africa. I have enjoyed getting to explore the nature through hiking, zip lining, and general exploration with my camera.
